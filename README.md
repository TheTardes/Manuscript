# Manuscript
This is my first project for **Typography and Interaction** class as MPS Communication Design student at Parsons The New School.
The goal of the project was to explore typography, implementing hierachy and communicating our designs.

## Inspiration
I have chosen ["Towards a Complex Simplicity"](https://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/towards-a-complex-simplicity) by Andrew Blauvelt, Daniel Eatock and Dave Eggers, pubclished in *The Eye Magazine*, as the artricle to build my work around. 

## Tools
I have used basic **html** and **css** to visualize my project as a website. I have incorporated tools like **VSCode** for coding and **Figma** for design, sketching and initial ideation.

## Design Approach
I focused on Readability by carefully selecting typefaces, establishing a clear hierarchy, and using a balanced color palette. **Navigation** and **Structure** were also prioritized to ensure an intuitive and engaging user experience.
