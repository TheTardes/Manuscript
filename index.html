                <strong><em>What defines contemporary graphic design today?</em></strong>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The shelves of your local bookshop provide at least one
                answer. Most books published on the so-called avant-garde of contemporary design represent the
                institutionalisations of graphic experimentation, only confirming that the radical signs surrounding
                design in the late 1980s and early 1990s have become thoroughly predictable. Not only has this kind of
                work become a marketable aesthetic niche, but it is perpetuated by educational institutions that
                dutifully churn out the latest incremental variations in formulaic fashion, fuelled by the twin myths of
                expressionism and stylistic pluralism.
            </p>
            <p>
                In his analysis of the 1980s art scene, the critic Hal Foster describes at least two conditions that
                identify a state of pluralism: a proliferation of accepted styles in the marketplace and a profusion of
                educational programmes that together constitute a new academy. I believe that graphic design operates
                under similar conditions today. The problem with pluralism is that styles become relative options, not
                critical choices. Although pluralism ensures many styles from which to choose, we lose any sense of
                critical alternatives because, as Foster states, <q><b><i>“tolerance and acceptance doesn't threaten the
                            status quo”</i></b></q>. Instead we have incremental or, in the parlance of 1990s economics,
                <b><i>“managed”</i></b> change. Just as the
                last round of <b><i>“radical”</i></b> graphics entered the profession in the late 1980s, many critics
                predicted an
                immediate opposite reaction, not understanding perhaps the speed and depth of assimilation such work
                would engender.
            </p>
            <p>
                The prevailing notion of what defines contemporary graphic design took hold early in the 1990s -
                variously and problematically referred to as Deconstructivism, grunge graphics, or simply, the
                <b><i>“cult of the ugly”</i></b>. In antithetical fashion, some critics foresaw an inevitable reaction
                to the
                trend by predicting a return to more minimal or reductive approaches. Emigre magazine devoted an issue
                to the
                subject (“Starting from Zero”) as early as 1991, in which the idea of reduction was taken to mean a
                return to the primal, and in 1995 Carel Kuitenbrouwer presciently saw the turn in contemporary Dutch
                design away from its baroque excesses and towards a <b><i>“new sobriety”</i></b> (Eye no. 17 vol. 5).
                The prophecies
                continue with the recent publication of Less Is More, by Steven Heller and Anne Fink, a collection of
                contemporary design defined by familiar yet retrograde notions of simplicity. <b>In the wake of these
                    predictions has the cult of complexity given way to an ethos of simplicity?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                There are signs of different forms of design taking hold, projects and solutions that embrace reductive
                not additive working methods, explicit rather than implicit structures of organisation, a preference for
                the literal over the ambiguous, and where the ordinary and the quotidian, not the exoticised subcultures
                of the vernacular, are sources of inspiration. At their best such projects are a critical encounter with
                problems of representation, both verbal and visual, rather than the next round of stylistic
                permutations. This shift away from the simply complex and towards a complex simplicity is a condition
                that I would like to read against many of the most celebrated characteristics of design produced in the
                1990s.

                <h2>
                    A complex simplicity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the realm of the simply complex, fragmentation is preferred as the viewer assembles various bits
                    of text and image to form an aggregate message. Such work tends to treat language as a free-floating
                    talisman, isolated words drifting across the page in search of meaning. By contrast a complex
                    simplicity relies on enumeration and explication, a series of digressions and elaborations linked in
                    the flow of language. What seems trivial and tangential becomes essential - like so many bits and
                    pieces of data in the detritus of the information age. This abundance of information is employed to
                    dramatic and occasionally humorous effect. Structure becomes paramount in order to handle large
                    quantities of texts and images: a penchant for charts, diagrams and maps prevails. But in the most
                    interesting work what appears to be good old information design reveals, upon closer examination,
                    something more subjective - a kind of over-rationalised explication - that undermines its historical
                    associations of neutrality and objectivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The diagrammatic and the eccentric converge in Timothy McSweeney's, a literary journal in which
                    words reign supreme. This is confirmed by the admonishment on the cover of issue two: <q
                        cite="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/"><b><i>“If
                                words are
                                to be used as design elements then let designers write them.”</i></b></q> Prone to
                    confabulation, this small,
                    book-like journal is set in only one typeface, Garamond, about which is provided a five-page
                    pseudo-colophon. McSweeney's is typically bereft of imagery, especially photography, preferring
                    small line illustrations and the occasional diagram or dingbat. Its well crafted covers evoke
                    Victorian typographic guises with elaborate extended prose and marginalia, while intricate charts
                    structure the contents of each issue in much the way that nineteenth-century physiognomy charts
                    tried to map human nature. McSweeney's relies on verbal explication and finds a visual corollary in
                    the diagram. The contents of issue two, for example, are represented by the number of words per
                    article and approximate reading time, and by a pie chart that categorises the offerings by
                    percentage, for example, <b><i>“Stories that want you to be happy: 19%.”</i></b> Carefully ordered,
                    but abhorrent
                    of white space, it leaves no place unused. Witness, from the third issue cover, messages such as
                    <b><i>“This area was blank for the longest time”</i></b> or <b><i>“Nothing need happen
                            here”</i></b>, or an article printed on
                    the spine. For McSweeney's the modernist principle of <b><i>“activated”</i></b> white space seems
                    empty, both
                    wasteful and useless, because every place is a seen as a potential space to hold meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also possible for the form to structure itself. For example, various bits of data taken
                    together form a powerful gestalt in Jeremy Coysten's poster series on aeroplane crashes and traffic
                    accidents. Coolly rendered as scatterplots, Coysten's Civil Airline Disasters 1950-1998 fixes the
                    location and death toll of 607 aviation tragedies, their resulting dispersal pattern forming an
                    image of the world. Coysten's poster was prompted by his own near-miss incident aboard a flight to
                    Australia. A second poster in the series documents road accidents in the uk over one week. In both
                    instances the rational forms of information design have been employed to register the seemingly
                    irrational loss of life. The calculated nature of the statistics contrasts with random events or
                    accidents. The posters are produced for sale and are not commissioned for public safety campaigns.
                    In this way information becomes both a product and a surrogate form of experience.

                <h2>
                    Sublimating expression
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While the overt intervention of the designer figured prominently as a signifier of self-expression,
                    one can detect the suspension of many of the designer's more subjective decision-making tasks. Like
                    forms of conceptual art, the preferred mode is more detached, relying on systematic approaches to
                    produce solutions. Sol LeWitt once proclaimed that <q><b><i>“If words are
                                to be used as design elements then let designers write them.”</i></b></q> The
                    systematic nature of a predetermined process generates its form, and in this way it is the process
                    itself that becomes the concept. Although the designer has not been entirely removed, what is
                    foregrounded is the visible traces of the process. Unlike some Modernist attempts at abandoning
                    subjectivity in favour of machine-like rationality, certain projects provide a framework for future
                    actions outside the usual control of the designer and are often completed by the viewer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An example of such participatory, rather than prescriptive, design is a poster by Paul Elliman for a
                    conference on the work of the French writer Lautréamont (see Eye no. 25 vol. 7, page 31). White
                    boxes have been inserted between the words <b><i>“image”</i></b>, <b><i>“Maldoror”</i></b> and
                    <b><i>“text”</i></b>, for conference
                    participants to complete, alter or negate. This simple gesture allows the project to generate a
                    multitude of responses, which as an action echoes the nature of the event's interpretive agenda. In
                    a similar but more extreme vein, Daniel Eatock's utilitarian poster project, essentially a generic
                    form silk-screened on newsprint paper, methodically guides the user through the steps of creating
                    their own advertisement, and includes blanks to insert relevant information, such as titles of
                    events, images, persons to contact, etc. In this instance the work is wholly dependent on viewer
                    response, the absence of which denies the piece its essential content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anne Burdick's design for Wörterbuch der Redensarten, a dictionary of idioms, demonstrates an
                    intricate form of complexity that weaves together various texts. Gathered from the work of Karl
                    Krauss's Die Fackel, a literary journal published between 1899 and 1936, Burdick worked with a group
                    of researchers in Vienna to generate a series of design directions for the subsequent layout of
                    1,056 pages. The aim of the project is interpretative, not exhaustive, therefore the body of the
                    text comprises only 144 expressions used by Krauss in Die Fackel. The purpose of this dictionary is
                    to register the nuances of Krauss's concepts and expressions. Representing a decidedly postmodern
                    <b><i>“tissue of quotations”</i></b>, Burdick has structured the pages so that the central column of
                    text includes
                    excerpts from Krauss's writings, while the left column contains citations and cross-references, and
                    the right column contains texts that perform <b><i>“interpretative actions”</i></b> on the main
                    passage. Because
                    Krauss often used typography and imagery semantically in his writings, the central column frequently
                    contains images and passages of text lifted directly from the original. Burdick acknowledges that
                    conventional assumptions of design authorship were hampered by both the scope of the project and the
                    barrier of a foreign language. Relying instead on a series of instructions, Burdick's solution
                    nevertheless bears the traces of the designer's close attention to the details that would allow the
                    project to realise its most appropriate polyphonic form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simple complexity demands typographic experimentation, highly articulated structures and eccentric
                    typefaces. By contrast, a complex simplicity revels in the spartan vocabulary of what might be
                    called <b><i>“vanilla typography”</i></b>, where typography has been reduced to a near-zero degree
                    of expression -
                    neither pretty nor eccentric, but quite plain. This is an inverted world where the ordinary stands
                    out from the crowd as a distinctive gesture. By comparison, yesteryear's shaped paragraph blocks and
                    micromanaged type treatments look like fussy affectations, so many histrionics in the passion play
                    of design. This change in typographies signals not only a shift in fashion, but also helps expose
                    the expressionistic fallacy behind much 1990s design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Expressionism denies its existence as a language, and thus a style, in order to preserve a sense of
                    immediacy, a supposedly unmediated or direct connection to individual desire and the unconscious.
                    Indeed, in most forms of contemporary design, expressionism has become synonymous with
                    individuality. While modern typography in the 1960s and 1970s could be easily linked with the
                    increasing rationality of the then-emerging industrial technocracy, today's similar but simpler
                    typography is aligned with the cultural sectors of fashion and art. This simplified approach to
                    typography, while relatively common to many culture magazines, is most often employed in conjunction
                    with the nouveau realist photography of the quotidian.

                <h2>
                    Picturing the everyday
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the more influential publications in this genre is Paris-based Purple, which surveys the
                    worlds of art, fashion, fiction, prose and interiors. Segregating the verbal (prose, fiction) from
                    the visual (art, fashion, interiors), Purple's preferred image is the snapshot, the most immediate
                    form of photographic address. Uncomplicated, unstudied, and frequently unstaged, the snapshot
                    negates the conditions of professional, commercial photography, with its requisite need for
                    elaborate lighting set-ups, make-up, styling and retouching. While images have undergone extensive
                    digital manipulation in the past decade, the recent resurgence of the snapshot makes one wonder
                    whether this form of representation is a critical alternative or simply a fashionable one. The
                    extensive presence of fashion advertising that mimics this look in the pages of Purple suggests the
                    latter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this image world, life is collected in pictures documenting the everyday in the face of a highly
                    mediated, spectacularised existence. The moment preserved by the snapshot is valued because it
                    signifies <b><i>“realness”</i></b>. This theme appears in cultiver notre jardin, by Jan van Toorn.
                    Using a
                    structure of perforated and folded pages, Van Toorn alternates between colour and black and white
                    images - pictures taken mainly by him - of people, friends and places around the world. Interspersed
                    through the book are quotations about social reality, mediated experience and notions of public and
                    private space, including a quote by social critic Mike Davis, who argues for a re-examination of
                    nineteenth-century realism and its relationship to everyday life. Van Toorn extols us to
                    <q><b><i>“cultivate
                                our own garden”</i></b></q>, by carving out a space in the public sphere in what have
                    become
                    expanding corporate
                    and institutional fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rather than striving to record moments of realness as it happens, other designers prefer a much more
                    mediated approach to representation. Eschewing visual ambiguity, including the clichéd stylistic
                    affectations of blurriness, the preferred mode of pictorial represent-ation is documentary realness
                    - not an attempt at capturing the authentic, but a much more studied trope that signifies the real
                    but does not try to stand in for it. This strategy is evinced in Jop van Bennekom's self-initiated
                    project, re-, a magazine about everyday life. In an issue devoted to sex, the cover models (a man
                    and a woman) appear fresh from a sexual encounter - replete with small beads of perspiration on
                    their faces. Inside, the clichés of sex are distributed accordingly - sexual innuendo and
                    phallicism, photos of stained mattresses and bits of blacked-out (“censored”) texts. Importantly,
                    the subjects of re- are ordinary people, not celebrities. The texts remain first-person accounts,
                    either testimonials, diaristic thoughts, or confessions.

                <p>
                    With the reconsideration of the ordinary and everyday within graphic design, one may ask whether we
                    are witnessing the end of what was once referred to as <b><i>“the society of the spectacle”</i></b>.
                    It is more
                    likely that with today's campaigns for global branding - the process that transforms the ordinary
                    into the memorable - we long for the less-mediated experiences found in the routines of daily life.
                    Perhaps we can't recognise the spectacle because it exists all around us.

                    After attending America: Cult and Culture, last year's AIGA [American Institute of Graphic Arts]
                    conference in Las Vegas (Reviews, Eye no. 34 vol. 9), it seemed all too easy to leave the spectacle
                    behind as my plane departed. Watching television at home, a group of rather ordinary young men and
                    women dressed casually but alike were singing along to an old Madonna tune. The minimal white stage
                    set and the uninflected karaoke ushered in the autumn season of clothing for The Gap and I found
                    myself transfixed: ordinary clothes worn by average people elevated to a new aesthetic. At that
                    moment it was difficult, but not impossible, to remember that the truly ordinary lies in opposition
                    to the brand. I was reminded of the architect Deborah Berke's warning, in writing about the
                    transformation of the landscape from banal to branded: <q><b><i>“To confuse ubiquitous logos with
                                generic
                                identity [is] to mistake successful marketing for 'popular' culture.”</i></b></q> At the
                    eclipse
                    of the society
                    of the spectacle, the ordinary is made extraordinary and the trivial and mundane become memorable.

                <strong>My Thoughts</strong>
            </h2>

                    <strong><em>Why do we need complex simplicity and how did we get to that point?</em></strong>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    I think, as humans, we tend to get bored with repetition but don't always want to put in excessive
                    effort. Complex simplicity captures this balance, offering designs that are minimal but still
                    engaging and thought-provoking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach reflects our psychological need for satisfaction and novelty without being
                    overwhelming. In the past, as the author mentions even so-called <b><i>"radical
                            experimentation"</i></b> in
                    design, I believe had an element of predictability, shaped by societal expectations and evolving as
                    those expectations shifted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my opinion, this is because design, like any art form, is shaped by societal trends and cultural
                    norms. While designers are pushing boundaries to create <b><i>“extraordinary”</i></b> they still
                    often respond to what society values or desires at the time. Initially they seem groundbreaking
                    however, as perceptions shift they become mainstream, ordinary. They this cycle repeats.

                    <strong><em>How much external factors affect how we perceive and create design?</em></strong>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    External factors, especially branding and cultural trends, heavily influence both how we perceive
                    and create designs. What is often considered extraordinary is, in many cases, a result of branding
                    infiltrations. <b>It makes me think that is there anything that is not under control of external
                        factors?</b> I do not think so. That is why the idea of something <b><i>"truly ordinary"</i></b>
                    can be difficult to
                    grasp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's ordinary for one person may be extraordinary for another. This subjectivity is what makes
                    individuals unique. In a way, truly ordinary might be our genuine opinions, reactions, and
                    reflections on something without considering external factors. <b>I'm not sure, but how would this
                        work
                        for design?</b> I don't think it's a good idea to design something without considering the user.
                    We need
                    consider common experiences, so, eventually things have to be repetitive, hence
                    <b><i>"ordinary"</i></b>. However,
                    what about design that gives consumers an experience? In some ways, experiences are unique for each
                    of us. I feel like there's still an external constraint. Even experiences are designed for certain
                    groups of people, and if there's something called a group, there's something common between them.
                    Hence, there's something similar and already adopted from the larger culture that actually formed
                    those groups.

                    <strong><em>Is what we call extraordinary still a result of branding infiltrations?</em></strong>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    So, while designs can feel personal, here is repetitiveness because designers must cater to a broad
                    audience. This naturally leads to some level of standardization, even in designs that try to provide
                    unique experiences. This interplay of individuality and external influence is what makes design both
                    personal and repetitive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, the concept of <b><i>"complex simplicity"</i></b> captures how current designs balance
                    minimalism with
                    complexity. This keeps consumers engaged and emotionally connected. Design trends are often shaped
                    by what consumers want, creating an ongoing cycle where both design and consumer expectations evolve
                    alongside one another.
