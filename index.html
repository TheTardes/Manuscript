                <p> <strong>What defines contemporary graphic design today?</strong> The shelves of your local bookshop provide at least one answer. Most books published on the so-called avant-garde of contemporary design represent the institutionalisations of graphic experimentation, only confirming that the radical signs surrounding design in the late <time>1980s</time> and early <time>1990s</time> have become thoroughly predictable.
                </p>
                <p> Not only has this kind of work become a marketable aesthetic niche, but it is perpetuated by educational institutions that dutifully churn out the latest incremental variations in formulaic fashion, fuelled by the twin myths of expressionism and stylistic pluralism.

                <p> In his analysis of the <time>1980s</time> art scene, the critic <a>Hal Foster</a> describes at least two conditions that identify a state of pluralism: a proliferation of accepted styles in the marketplace and a profusion of educational programmes that together constitute a new academy. I believe that graphic design operates under similar conditions today. The problem with pluralism is that styles become relative options, not critical choices.
                </p>
                <p> Although pluralism ensures many styles from which to choose, we lose any sense of critical alternatives because, as Foster states, <q>tolerance and acceptance doesn't threaten the status quo</q>. Instead we have incremental or, in the parlance of <time>1990s</time> economics, <span class="in-text-quote">"managed"</span> change. Just as the last round of <span class="in-text-quote">"radical"</span> graphics entered the profession in the late <time>1998s</time>, many critics predicted an immediate opposite reaction, not understanding perhaps the speed and depth of assimilation such work would engender.

                <p> The prevailing notion of what defines contemporary graphic design took hold early in the <time>1990s</time> - variously and problematically referred to as Deconstructivism, grunge graphics, or simply, the <span class="in-text-quote">"cult of the ugly"</span>. In antithetical fashion, some critics foresaw an inevitable reaction to the trend by predicting a return to more minimal or reductive approaches.
                </p>
                <p> <a>Emigre Magazine</a> devoted an issue to the subject (“Starting from Zero”) as early as <time>1991</time>, in which the idea of reduction was taken to mean a return to the primal, and in <time>1995</time> <a>Carel Kuitenbrouwer</a> presciently saw the turn in contemporary Dutch design away from its baroque excesses and towards a <span class="in-text-quote">"new sobriety"</span> (Eye no. 17 vol. 5).

                <p> The prophecies continue with the recent publication of Less Is More, by <a>Steven Heller</a> and <a>Anne Fink</a>, a collection of contemporary design defined by familiar yet retrograde notions of simplicity. In the wake of these predictions has the cult of complexity given way to an ethos of simplicity?

                <p> There are signs of different forms of design taking hold, projects and solutions that embrace reductive not additive working methods, explicit rather than implicit structures of organisation, a preference for the literal over the ambiguous, and where the ordinary and the quotidian, not the exoticised subcultures of the vernacular, are sources of inspiration. At their best such projects are a critical encounter with problems of representation, both verbal and visual, rather than the next round of stylistic permutations.

                <p> This shift away from the simply complex and towards a complex simplicity is a condition that I would like to read against many of the most celebrated characteristics of design produced in the <time>1990s</time>.

                    <p> In the realm of the simply complex, fragmentation is preferred as the viewer assembles various bits of text and image to form an aggregate message. Such work tends to treat language as a free-floating talisman, isolated words drifting across the page in search of meaning. By contrast a complex simplicity relies on enumeration and explication, a series of digressions and elaborations linked in the flow of language. What seems trivial and tangential becomes essential - like so many bits and pieces of data in the detritus of the information age.
                    </p>
                    <p> This abundance of information is employed to dramatic and occasionally humorous effect. Structure becomes paramount in order to handle large quantities of texts and images: a penchant for charts, diagrams and maps prevails. But in the most interesting work what appears to be good old information design reveals, upon closer examination, something more subjective - a kind of over-rationalised explication - that undermines its historical associations of neutrality and objectivity.

                    <p> McSweeney’s is typically bereft of imagery, especially photography, preferring small line illustrations and the occasional diagram or dingbat.

                    <p> McSweeney’s relies on verbal explication and finds a visual corollary in the diagram. The contents of issue two, for example, are represented by the number of words per article and approximate reading time, and by a pie chart that categorises the offerings by percentage, for example:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> Stories that want you to be happy: 19%. Carefully ordered, but abhorrent of white space, it leaves no place unused. Witness, from the third issue cover, messages such as <span class="in-text-quote">"This area was blank for the longest time"</span>.

                    <p> For McSweeney’s the modernist principle of <span class="in-text-quote">"activated"</span> white space seems empty, both wasteful and useless, because every place is a seen as a potential space to hold meaning.

                    <p> It is also possible for the form to structure itself. For example, various bits of data taken together form a powerful gestalt in <a>Jeremy Coysten</a>’s poster series on aeroplane crashes and traffic accidents. Coolly rendered as scatterplots, Coysten’s Civil Airline Disasters <time>1950-1998</time> fixes the location and death toll of 607 aviation tragedies, their resulting dispersal pattern forming an image of the world. Coysten’s poster was prompted by his own near-miss incident aboard a flight to Australia.

                    <p> A second poster in the series documents road accidents in the uk over one week. In both instances the rational forms of information design have been employed to register the seemingly irrational loss of life. The calculated nature of the statistics contrasts with random events or accidents. The posters are produced for sale and are not commissioned for public safety campaigns. In this way information becomes both a product and a surrogate form of experience.

                    <p> While the overt intervention of the designer figured prominently as a signifier of self-expression, one can detect the suspension of many of the designer’s more subjective decision-making tasks. Like forms of conceptual art, the preferred mode is more detached, relying on systematic approaches to produce solutions. Sol LeWitt once proclaimed that <q>the idea is the machine that makes the art</q>. The systematic nature of a predetermined process generates its form, and in this way it is the process itself that becomes the concept.
                    </p>
                    <p> Although the designer has not been entirely removed, what is foregrounded is the visible traces of the process. Unlike some Modernist attempts at abandoning subjectivity in favour of machine-like rationality, certain projects provide a framework for future actions outside the usual control of the designer and are often completed by the viewer.

                    <p> An example of such participatory, rather than prescriptive, design is a poster by Paul Elliman for a conference on the work of the French writer Lautréamont (see Eye no. 25 vol. 7, page 31). White boxes have been inserted between the words <span class="in-text-quote">"image"</span>, <span class="in-text-quote">"Maldoror"</span> and <span class="in-text-quote">“text”</span>, for conference participants to complete, alter or negate.

                    <p> In a similar but more extreme vein, Daniel Eatock’s utilitarian poster project, essentially a generic form silk-screened on newsprint paper, methodically guides the user through the steps of creating their own advertisement, and includes blanks to insert relevant information, such as titles of events, images, persons to contact, etc. In this instance the work is wholly dependent on viewer response, the absence of which denies the piece its essential content.

                    <p> Anne Burdick’s design for Wörterbuch der Redensarten, a dictionary of idioms, demonstrates an intricate form of complexity that weaves together various texts. Gathered from the work of Karl Krauss’s Die Fackel, a literary journal published between <time>1899</time> and <time>1936</time>, Burdick worked with a group of researchers in Vienna to generate a series of design directions for the subsequent layout of 1,056 pages. The aim of the project is interpretative, not exhaustive, therefore the body of the text comprises only 144 expressions used by Krauss in Die Fackel. The purpose of this dictionary is to register the nuances of Krauss’s concepts and expressions.
                    </p>
                    <p> Representing a decidedly postmodern <span class="in-text-quote">“tissue of quotations”</span>, Burdick has structured the pages so that the central column of text includes excerpts from Krauss’s writings, while the left column contains citations and cross-references, and the right column contains texts that perform <span class="in-text-quote">“interpretative actions”</span> on the main passage. Because Krauss often used typography and imagery semantically in his writings, the central column frequently contains images and passages of text lifted directly from the original. </p>
                    <p> Burdick acknowledges that conventional assumptions of design authorship were hampered by both the scope of the project and the barrier of a foreign language. Relying instead on a series of instructions, Burdick’s solution nevertheless bears the traces of the designer’s close attention to the details that would allow the project to realise its most appropriate polyphonic form.

                    <p> One of the more influential publications in this genre is Paris-based Purple, which surveys the worlds of art, fashion, fiction, prose and interiors. Segregating the verbal (prose, fiction) from the visual (art, fashion, interiors), Purple’s preferred image is the snapshot, the most immediate form of photographic address. Uncomplicated, unstudied, and frequently unstaged, the snapshot negates the conditions of professional, commercial photography, with its requisite need for elaborate lighting set-ups, make-up, styling and retouching.
                    </p>
                    <p> While images have undergone extensive digital manipulation in the past decade, the recent resurgence of the snapshot makes one wonder whether this form of representation is a critical alternative or simply a fashionable one. The extensive presence of fashion advertising that mimics this look in the pages of Purple suggests the latter.

                    <p> Rather than striving to record moments of realness as it happens, other designers prefer a much more mediated approach to representation. Eschewing visual ambiguity, including the clichéd stylistic affectations of blurriness, the preferred mode of pictorial represent-ation is documentary realness - not an attempt at capturing the authentic, but a much more studied trope that signifies the real but does not try to stand in for it.

It is more likely that with today’s campaigns for global branding – the process that transforms the ordinary into the memorable – we long for the less-mediated experiences found in the routines of daily life. Perhaps we can’t recognise the spectacle because it exists all around us.

                    <p> After attending America: Cult and Culture, last year’s AIGA [American Institute of Graphic Arts] conference in Las Vegas (Reviews, Eye no. 34 vol. 9), it seemed all too easy to leave the spectacle behind as my plane departed. Watching television at home, a group of rather ordinary young men and women dressed casually but alike were singing along to an old Madonna tune. </p>

                    <p> The minimal white stage set and the uninflected karaoke ushered in the autumn season of clothing for The Gap and I found myself transfixed: <span class="in-text-quote">ordinary clothes worn by average people elevated to a new aesthetic.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p> At that moment it was difficult, but not impossible, to remember that the truly ordinary lies in opposition to the brand. I was reminded of the architect Deborah Berke’s warning, in writing about the transformation of the landscape from banal to branded: <q>To confuse ubiquitous logos with generic identity [is] to mistake successful marketing for ‘popular’ culture.</q> At the eclipse of the society of the spectacle, the ordinary is made extraordinary and the trivial and mundane become memorable.

            <section>
                <h3 class="heading-3"> Why do we need <span class="heading-3-light">complex</span> simplicity and how did we get to that point? </h3>
                <p> I think, as humans, we tend to get bored with repetition but don't always want to put in excessive effort. Complex simplicity captures this balance, offering designs that are minimal but still engaging and thought-provoking. This approach reflects our psychological need for satisfaction and novelty without being overwhelming.
                </p>
                <p> In the past, as the author mentions even so-called <span class="in-text-quote">"radical experimentation"</span> in design, I believe had an element of predictability, shaped by societal expectations and evolving as those expectations shifted.
                </p>
                <p> In my opinion, this is because design, like any art form, is shaped by societal trends and cultural norms. While designers are pushing boundaries to create <span class="in-text-quote">“extraordinary”</span> they still often respond to what society values or desires at the time. Initially they seem groundbreaking however, as perceptions shift they become mainstream, ordinary. They this cycle repeats.

            <section>
                <h3 class="heading-3"> How much <span class="heading-3-light">external</span> factors affect how we perceive and create design? </h3>
                <p> External factors, especially branding and cultural trends, heavily influence both how we perceive and create designs. What is often considered extraordinary is, in many cases, a result of branding infltrations. <strong>It makes me think that is there anything that is not under control of external factors?</strong> I do not think so. That is why the idea of something <span class="in-text-quote">"truly ordinary"</span> can be difficult to grasp.
                </p>
                <p> What's ordinary for one person may be extraordinary for another. This subjectivity is what makes individuals unique. In a way, truly ordinary might be our genuine opinions, reactions, and reflections on something without considering external factors. <strong>I'm not sure, but how would this work for design?</strong> I don't think it's a good idea to design something without considering the user. We need consider common experiences, so, eventually things have to be repetitive, hence <span class="in-text-quote">"ordinary"</span>.
                </p>
                <p> <strong>However, what about design that gives consumers an experience?</strong> In some ways, experiences are unique for each of us. I feel like there's still an external constraint. Even experiences are designed for certain groups of people, and if there's something called a group, there's something common between them. Hence, there's something similar and already adopted from the larger culture that actually formed those groups.

                <h3 class="heading-3"> Is what we call <span class="heading-3-light">extraordinary</span> still a result of branding infiltrations? </h3>
                <p> So, while designs can feel personal, here is repetitiveness because designers must cater to a broad audience. This naturally leads to some level of standardization, even in designs that try to provide unique experiences. This interplay of individuality and external influence is what makes design both personal and repetitive.
                </p>
                <p> Ultimately, the concept of <span class="in-text-quote">"complex simplicity"</span> captures how current designs balance minimalism with complexity. This keeps consumers engaged and emotionally connected. Design trends are often shaped by what consumers want, creating an ongoing cycle where both design and consumer expectations evolve alongside one another.
