                <p> <strong>What defines contemporary graphic design today?</strong> The shelves of your local bookshop provide at least one answer. Most books published on the so-called avant-garde of contemporary design represent the institutionalisations of graphic experimentation, only confirming that the radical signs surrounding design in the late <time>1980s</time> and early <time>1990s</time> have become thoroughly predictable.
                </p>
                <p> Not only has this kind of work become a marketable aesthetic niche, but it is perpetuated by educational institutions that dutifully churn out the latest incremental variations in formulaic fashion, fuelled by the twin myths of expressionism and stylistic pluralism.

                    <p> In his analysis of the <time>1980s</time> art scene, the critic <a href="https://artandarchaeology.princeton.edu/people/hal-foster" class="trigger-1">Hal Foster</a> describes at least two conditions that identify a state of pluralism: a proliferation of accepted styles in the marketplace and a profusion of educational programmes that together constitute a new academy. I believe that graphic design operates under similar conditions today. The problem with pluralism is that styles become relative options, not critical choices.
                    </p>
                    <p> Although pluralism ensures many styles from which to choose, we lose any sense of critical alternatives because, as Foster states, <q>tolerance and acceptance doesn't threaten the status quo</q>. Instead we have incremental or, in the parlance of <time>1990s</time> economics, <span>"managed"</span> change. Just as the last round of <span>"radical"</span> graphics entered the profession in the late <time>1998s</time>, many critics predicted an immediate opposite reaction, not understanding perhaps the speed and depth of assimilation such work would engender.

                <p> There are signs of different forms of design taking hold, projects and solutions that embrace reductive not additive working methods, explicit rather than implicit structures of organisation, a preference for the literal over the ambiguous, and where the ordinary and the quotidian, not the exoticised subcultures of the vernacular, are sources of inspiration. At their best such projects are a critical encounter with problems of representation, both verbal and visual, rather than the next round of stylistic permutations.

                    <p> In the realm of the simply complex, fragmentation is preferred as the viewer assembles various bits of text and image to form an aggregate message. Such work tends to treat language as a free-floating talisman, isolated words drifting across the page in search of meaning. By contrast a complex simplicity relies on enumeration and explication, a series of digressions and elaborations linked in the flow of language. What seems trivial and tangential becomes essential - like so many bits and pieces of data in the detritus of the information age.
                    </p>
                    <p> This abundance of information is employed to dramatic and occasionally humorous effect. Structure becomes paramount in order to handle large quantities of texts and images: a penchant for charts, diagrams and maps prevails. But in the most interesting work what appears to be good old information design reveals, upon closer examination, something more subjective - a kind of over-rationalised explication - that undermines its historical associations of neutrality and objectivity.

                    <p> McSweeney’s relies on verbal explication and finds a visual corollary in the diagram. The contents of issue two, for example, are represented by the number of words per article and approximate reading time, and by a pie chart that categorises the offerings by percentage, for example:

                    <ul>
                        <li> Stories that want you to be happy: 19%. Carefully ordered, but abhorrent of white space, it leaves no place unused. Witness, from the third issue cover, messages such as <span>"This area was blank for the longest time"</span>.

                        <p> It is also possible for the form to structure itself. For example, various bits of data taken together form a powerful gestalt in <a href="https://jeremycoysten.com/" class="trigger-1">Jeremy Coysten</a>’s poster series on aeroplane crashes and traffic accidents. Coolly rendered as scatterplots, Coysten’s Civil Airline Disasters <time>1950-1998</time> fixes the location and death toll of 607 aviation tragedies, their resulting dispersal pattern forming an image of the world. Coysten’s poster was prompted by his own near-miss incident aboard a flight to Australia.

                        <p> A second poster in the series documents road accidents in the uk over one week. In both instances the rational forms of information design have been employed to register the seemingly irrational loss of life. The calculated nature of the statistics contrasts with random events or accidents. The posters are produced for sale and are not commissioned for public safety campaigns. In this way information becomes both a product and a surrogate form of experience.

                        <p> Representing a decidedly postmodern <span>“tissue of quotations”</span>, Burdick has structured the pages so that the central column of text includes excerpts from Krauss’s writings, while the left column contains citations and cross-references, and the right column contains texts that perform <span>“interpretative actions”</span> on the main passage. Because Krauss often used typography and imagery semantically in his writings, the central column frequently contains images and passages of text lifted directly from the original. </p>
                        <p> Burdick acknowledges that conventional assumptions of design authorship were hampered by both the scope of the project and the barrier of a foreign language. Relying instead on a series of instructions, Burdick’s solution nevertheless bears the traces of the designer’s close attention to the details that would allow the project to realise its most appropriate polyphonic form.

                    <p> Simple complexity demands typographic experimentation, highly articulated structures and eccentric typefaces.

                    <p> Expressionism denies its existence as a language, and thus a style, in order to preserve a sense of immediacy, a supposedly unmediated or direct connection to individual desire and the unconscious. Indeed, in most forms of contemporary design, expressionism has become synonymous with individuality.

                    <p> While modern typography in the <time>1960s</time> and <time>1970s</time> could be easily linked with the increasing rationality of the then-emerging industrial technocracy, today’s similar but simpler typography is aligned with the cultural sectors of fashion and art. This simplified approach to typography, while relatively common to many culture magazines, is most often employed in conjunction with the nouveau realist photography of the quotidian.

                    <p> One of the more influential publications in this genre is Paris-based Purple, which surveys the worlds of art, fashion, fiction, prose and interiors. Segregating the verbal (prose, fiction) from the visual (art, fashion, interiors), Purple’s preferred image is the snapshot, the most immediate form of photographic address. Uncomplicated, unstudied, and frequently unstaged, the snapshot negates the conditions of professional, commercial photography, with its requisite need for elaborate lighting set-ups, make-up, styling and retouching.

                <h3 class="heading-3"> Why do we need <span>complex</span> simplicity and how did we get to that point? </h3>
                <section>
                    <p> We as humans always strive for something different and get tired of repetitiveness. However, we also do not want to put too much effort into things (depending on what we are doing). Though we eventually want to see satisfaction, and achievement without the effort put into it we do not enjoy it much. I think this concept of <span>“complex simplicity”</span> is basically the result of human psychological need.
                    </p>
                    <p>I feel like even in the past, <span>"radical experimentation"</span> that the author mentions in contrast to <span>“predictable”</span> design today, had some predictability. I believe it was shaped by what society wanted and then got modified when the society got tired or sought for more.
                    </p>
                    <p> In my opinion, this is because design, like any art form, is shaped by societal trends and cultural norms. While designers are pushing boundaries to create <span>“extraordinary”</span> they still often respond to what society values or desires at the time. Initially they seem groundbreaking however, as perceptions shift they become mainstream, ordinary. They this cycle repeats.

            <section>
                <h3 class="heading-3"> How much <span>external</span> factors affect how we perceive and create design? </h3>
                <section>
                    <p> External factors, especially branding and cultural trends, heavily influence both how we perceive and create designs. What is often considered extraordinary is, in many cases, a result of branding infltrations. <strong>It makes me think that is there anything that is not under control of external factors?</strong> I do not think so. That is why the idea of something <span>"truly ordinary"</span> can be difficult to grasp.
                    </p>
                    <p> When the author calls something truly ordinary, my mind gets confused and blank in a way that I feel like it is very unique and personal and one’s judgment of the ordinary is different from others. I feel like this is what makes each of us ordinary. In a way, truly ordinary might be our genuine opinions, reactions, and reflections on something without considering external factors. <strong>I'm not sure, but how would this work for design?</strong> I don't think it's a good idea to design something without considering the user. We need consider common experiences, so, eventually things have to be repetitive, hence <span>"ordinary"</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p> <strong>However, what about design that gives consumers an experience?</strong>In some ways, experiences are unique for each of us. However, I feel like there's still an external constraint. Even experiences are designed for certain groups of people, and if there's something called a group, there's something common.

                <section>
                    <p>
                        While designs can feel personal, there is repetitiveness because designers must cater to a broad audience. This naturally leads to some level of standardization, even in designs that try to provide unique experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, everything is still about what consumers want. I feel like consumers shape the trends anyway. So, marketing campaigns, unless politically or intentionally crafted, usually aim to produce whatever their consumers wish to see and interact with. This is an interchangeable process, and both designs and experiences shape each other while evolving.

                    <section>
                        <p>
                            The complex simplicity, as a concept portrays how in minimalist design there would be deeper structure and meaning. This is central to the contemporary practice of interaction design. Offering “easy to navigate”, simple, clean interfaces while keeping users busy with underneath tasks is core to user-friendly experience which is what “complex simplicity” holds up to too.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, I do not have strong disagreements with the authors but rather many of the thoughts made me think deeper about the philosophy of how the idea of <span>“complexity”</span> and <span>“simplicity”</span> interchangeably go together in design.

                    The goal was to capture the idea of "complex simplicity" in my project. So, I created a minimalist layout with some elements of depth. Hence, while it is simple, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing, beneath the surface, it is structured and has a certain complexity to deliver a full experience.
